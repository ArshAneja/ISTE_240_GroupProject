                <h2>What is Python?</h2>

                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
                    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it 
                    very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language 
                    to connect existing components together.Some of the most common uses being Machine Learning, Data Analytics, 
                    Web Frameworks, Testing Suites, and so much more.</p>
